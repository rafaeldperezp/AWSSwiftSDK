/// DataSync DataSync is a managed data transfer service that makes it simpler for you to automate moving data between on-premises storage and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). This API interface reference for DataSync contains documentation for a programming interface that you can use to manage DataSync.
public protocol DataSyncClientProtocol {
    /// Cancels execution of a task. When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files is abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution.

    /// Activates an DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the Amazon Web Services Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the Amazon Web Services Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this Amazon Web Services Region. You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public internet. You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run. Agents are automatically updated by Amazon Web Services on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.

    /// Creates a task. A task includes a source location and a destination location, and a configuration that specifies how data is transferred. A task always transfers data from the source location to the destination location. The configuration specifies options such as task scheduling, bandwidth limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data transfer. When you create a task that transfers data between Amazon Web Services services in different Amazon Web Services Regions, one of the two locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync is being used. The other location must be specified in a different Region. You can transfer data between commercial Amazon Web Services Regions except for China, or between Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions. When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between Amazon Web Services Regions, you pay for data transfer between Regions. This is billed as data transfer OUT from your source Region to your destination Region. For more information, see [Data Transfer pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer).
