/// This is the Recycle Bin API Reference. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in Recycle Bin. Recycle Bin is a snapshot recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally deleted snapshots. When using Recycle Bin, if your snapshots are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify. You can restore a snapshot from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period expires. After you restore a snapshot from the Recycle Bin, the snapshot is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the same way you use any other snapshot in your account. If the retention period expires and the snapshot is not restored, the snapshot is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for recovery. For more information about Recycle Bin, see [ Recycle Bin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-recycle-bin.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
