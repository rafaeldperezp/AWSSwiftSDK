/// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature. You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features and backend features.

Evidently then checks the evaluation rules and assigns the variation. The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules.

Next, if there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to a variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is enrolled in the launch, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the launch.

The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that experiment. If the user is enrolled in the experiment, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the experiment. If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served the default variation.
